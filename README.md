- ### Sahayak -a vigilant antidrug companion, is a dedicated chatbot committed to providing support and information.Main objective of this chatbot is to handle sensative chats of drugs & alcohol, as it gives remedies & specialized responses.Therefore our main goal is to finetune the chatbot over such sensitive data, & drug addicted person can use & ask questions freely
- ### With empathy as its core, Sahayak aims to guide users away from the clutches of substance abuse, offering resources, encouragement, and a listening ear. 
- ### Harnessing technology for a healthier tomorrow, Sahayak stands as a reliable ally in the fight against drugs, promoting a drug-free lifestyle through understanding and assistance using technologies like finetuning, small language model (SLM), PEFT, Lora, Python, Anvil, Cloud, tensorflow, NLP, pytorch, Phi-2 by Microsoft,
- ### The main purpose of the project is give the users companion which will eventually guide and educate its users about the bad effects of the drugs eventually leading to a drug-free society.
## Key Highlights
- ### Data Preparation
Prepare a dataset in the required format (JSONL) with input-output pairs or any suitable format.
- ### Set Up GPU and Environment
 Utilize Google Colab ,AWS Sagemaker or a similar platform to obtain GPU resources.Choose appropriate specifications (e.g., Python version, CUDA version) for the environment.Build and configure the environment using the provided badge.
- ### Load Base Model (Phi-2)
Load the Phi-2 model using 8-bit quantization for efficient training.
- ### Tokenization
Set up the tokenizer, considering padding, truncation, and max_length.Tokenize the dataset for training and validation.
- ### Set Up LoRA
Apply preprocessing to the model for training using LoRA layers.Define LoRA configurations for the model.
- ### Run Training
Train the model using the provided Trainer class.Monitor training metrics and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

- ### Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on a sample prompt to check performance.
- ### User Interface (UI) Integration
Utilize Anvil to create a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.
